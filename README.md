# A versioned database for leaf <sup>13</sup>C values from across the world

-----------------------

## How to use this package

#### Install the required packages

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/datastorr")
devtools::install_github("wcornwell/leaf_13C")
library(leaf_13C)
```
This should download the most recent version of the database on to your computer and load it into R.  

As the database moves forward the version number will change, but access to older versions will be possible through the R package, the Github Releases page, and the Zenodo DOI.
